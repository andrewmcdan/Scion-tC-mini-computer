Scion-tC-mini-computer
======================

Scion tC mini computer based on Arduino, RaspPi, and Android

This is my project to add an Android tablet to my car. I will be working on a thorough write-up as I progress through this project. It can be found here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vaih9PYs1yR0XOHnxhHdJ4_YmUEM3GJh4ViGSrFdeR8/edit?usp=sharing

Please keep in mind that the write-up is a work-in-progress so there are bound to be grammatical/spelling errors and minor inconsistencies. If you find any, please leave a comment on the Google Docs file. Also feel free to leave any comments/suggestions as comments in that file.


Tests
-----

While I work on this project, I will be doing various tests with communication variables, low power modes, and input/output methods. When I write useful test code, I will commit it to the "Tests" folder.
